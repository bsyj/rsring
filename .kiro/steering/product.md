# Product Overview

RS Ring is a Minecraft 1.12.2 mod that adds magical rings and experience management devices to the game. The mod integrates with the Baubles accessory system to provide wearable items with special abilities.

## Core Features

**Chest Ring**: Automatically collects items within 8 blocks and transfers them to a bound chest. Supports cross-dimensional transfer, toggle control (K key), and FE energy consumption.

**Experience System**: Includes Experience Pump (collects XP), Experience Tank (stores XP as liquid), and Experience Pump Controller (manages XP transfer between tanks and player).

**Baubles Integration**: Full support for wearing rings and tanks in Baubles accessory slots with proper synchronization and inventory tracking.

## Key Design Principles

- Energy-driven mechanics using Forge Energy (FE)
- Cross-dimensional functionality
- Configurable blacklist/whitelist filtering
- Cyclic mod GUI style and conventions
- Optional Baubles dependency with graceful degradation
